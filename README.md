### What will be the benefit of using this Vagrant implementation?

Oracle RAC is a complex technology, once you start learning, and you want to start over or add some new option, this project will allow you automate the OS deploy and OS configuration part, so you can expend time on the feature you want to explore.

> Architecture is the same as the 12c at home book. For simplicity, and looking to the future, some names will be change.
